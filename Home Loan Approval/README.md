# Home Loan Approval

## Introduction
I wanted to practice EDA and Machine Learning on a financal themed dataset, and what could have been better than going round the evergreen question:
will the client get the loan?

## Dataset
### Source:

### Description:
This public dataset consists of two CSV file, from them I'll use the train dataset. 
It holds records of customers' social and economic circumstances and their approval status for loan.

## Technologies used:
Python with numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and plotpy libraries used in Jupyter Notebook.

## Tasks carried out:
- Explored and cleaned data (handled duplicates, outliers and missing values, extracted the valuable information of the columns)
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on data. Checked all variables' relation to the loan status using statistical methods (Chi-square and two-sample t test).
- Built a machine learning model (Random Forest) to predict loan approval. Evaluated the results.
