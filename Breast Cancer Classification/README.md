# Breast Cancer Classification

## Introduction
I made a prediction as to whether a tumour in the breast is benign or malignant, based on the available data. For that cause after a brief data processing and feature engineering, I built a neural network with tensorflow.

## Dataset
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nancyalaswad90/breast-cancer-dataset/
This public dataset consists of a csv file. It holds records of breast tumors' properties and wether they are bening or malignent.

## Technologies used
Python with numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow, matplotlib

## Task carried out:
- Processed data, conducted EDA, labelled categorical values
- Built a neural network model with an input, a hidden and an output layer
- Evaluated the model

## Credits
I thank Shiddhardan for his original work on this dataset
