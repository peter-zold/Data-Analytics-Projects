# Brief descriptions of the projects
I wrote some descriptions of my data analytics and science projects for easier navigation.

## HR Management Application
HR Management Application is a softwere used for management and analysis for a fictitious company database. In addition to CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), the application is capable of statistical evaluation of data and make predictions based on a machine learning model.

I used <b>Python</b> (with numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost and so on) and <b>SQL</b> (sqlite3 and sqlean extension) to create this project.

## Home Loan Approval
I analyzed a dataset consisting customers' social and economic circumstances and their approval status for loan. I performed a thorough EDA with hypthesis testing, and also built a machine learning model predicting loan approval.

I used <b>Python</b> (with numpy, pandas, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn and so on) to create this project.

## Breast Cancer Classification
I made a prediction as to whether a tumour in the breast is benign or malignant, based on the available data. For that cause after a brief data processing and feature engineering, I built a neural network with tensorflow.

I used <b>Python</b> (with numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow, matplotlib) to create this project.

## Students Performance In Exams
I conducted analysis on a dataset with records of students socioeconomic status, preparation and exam results. I made a report with summarization of the student's overall performance with the possibility to filter on various attributes. I also an analysis on some aspects of their individual performance featuring key influencers of scoring high or low on an exam.

I used <b>Power BI</b> and <b>Power Query</b> to create this project.

## US Baby Names
I analyzed a database of names to find out what are the specificities of naming trends, how and why did the changes happen, and possibly uncover the reasons behind it. I focused on more popular names, be they annual hits or evergreen ones.

I used <b>Python</b> (with numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and so on) to create this project.

## Suicide Rates
I conducted an exploratory analysis on a database of suicide counts, making spectacular visualizations in the process. I also set up separate statistics for worldwide data, and for continents and countries. Furthermore I have visualised the main factors influencing the number of suicides.

I used <b>Power BI</b> and <b>Power Query</b> to create this project.
